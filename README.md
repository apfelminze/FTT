  Let your Arduino play "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
  </h2>
  <ol> 
    <li>
    Download the software "Arduino IDE". It is used to write code for the Arduino and upload this code on the Arduino. You can download the program here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
  </li>
    <li>
      For Linux: After you downloaded the program as an AppImage (a file that is called something similar to "arduino-ide_2.1.1_Linux_64bit.AppImage"), you need to make it executable. You can do by going to your Download folder (or whereever you saved the AppImage file), right-click, choose "Open a Terminal here" and then enter the following command:
      <code>chmod +x APPIMAGE </code>
      where instead of APPIMAGE you have to write the name of the file, for example "arduino-ide_2.1.1_Linux_64bit.AppImage". Press Enter to execute this command. When there is no error message, it means this command has worked well.
    </li>
    <li>
      For Linux: Then you can start the program by writing another command to the terminal:
      <code>
        ./APPIMAGE
      </code>
      Again, you need to exchange APPIMAGE for the name of your file, for example "arduino-ide_2.1.1_Linux_64bit.AppImage".
      The program will now open in another window. You need to leave the Terminal open as long as you want to use the program
